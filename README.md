# Elevator Project
## External Code
External code used for this project include the network module, except network.go itself, the hardware module which is slightly modified from the version found on the class repository. The cost function has been translated from [1.1 in project resources]{https://github.com/TTK4145/Project-resources/tree/master/cost_fns}, this uses functions inspired by the [elevator algorithm in D]{https://github.com/TTK4145/Project-resources/blob/master/cost_fns/hall_request_assigner/elevator_algorithm.d} which are modified to fit our program.
